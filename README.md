# VET CLINIC DATABASE

> Vet Clinic is the first project of the Ruby / Databases and Interviewing at Microverse. Vet Clinic is a Relational database with a table that is created to store information about animals.


## Getting Started

This repository includes files with plain SQL that can be used to recreate a database:

- Used [schema.sql](./schema.sql) to create all tables.
- Used [data.sql](./data.sql) to populate tables with sample data.
- Checked [queries.sql](./queries.sql) for examples of queries that can be run on a newly created database. **Important note: this file might include queries that make changes in the database (e.g., remove records). Use them responsibly!**
